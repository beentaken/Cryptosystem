Cryptosystem
============

A program that simulate some cryptography system and perform some algorithms to encrypt and decrypt messages. This program have three types of algorithms, ElGamal, RSA, and Knapsack algorithms. There are also a Prime Generator tool and configuration for the maximum value for the keys used in the program.
  
This program was influenced from the book, *Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications 7th Edition (Chapter 4 Number Theory and Cryptography)*. This program can only encrypt alphabetic characters, and it encrypts two characters at once. The resulting cipher text will be in the format of only numbers.
